# profile-editor

In this project, I worked with and existing backend, used fetch API to handle forms. The page shows these input fields: first name, surname, address (zip, country, city, street, house number), profile image and introduction. There is save and delete button on the page as well. Clicking on the save button is saving the data from fields into a json file and the image to a jpg file without reloading the page. If you click on the delete button, this is deleting all the data and emptying all the input fields without reloading the page.
